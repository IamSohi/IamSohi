### Hi there 👋🏼I'm Sukhveer, a tech-enthusiast and self-driven individual with a passion for building things.
#### I'm interested in anything tech — especially web development and machine learning. I graduated from Kwantlen Polytechnic University in May 2020. My major was Computer Science and Information Systems. I have applied experience in developing full-stack web applications, server-less systems, and DevOps. 

#### In my free time, I love networking with people, listen to music, do some reading and sometimes enjoys cooking. I have a knack for bringing technology, business, science and philosophy in every discussion.

#### Browse the projects repositories to see some of my work or feel free to reach out!
