### Hi there 👋🏼I'm Sukhveer, a tech-enthusiast and self-driven individual with a passion for building things.
#### I'm interested in anything tech — particularly in the realms of full-stack development and AI-driven solutions. I specialize in advanced software for web applications and machine learning, leveraging serverless architectures and DevOps practices. Recently, I've enhanced my skills in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering, creating tools that boost productivity and engagement. Since earning my Computer Science diploma from Kwantlen Polytechnic University, I have dedicated myself to building innovative tools that streamline workflows and improve user experiences.

#### In my free time, I love networking with people, listen to music, do some reading and sometimes enjoys cooking. I have a knack for bringing technology, business, science and philosophy in every discussion.

#### Browse the projects repositories to see some of my work or feel free to reach out!
